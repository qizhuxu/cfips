## üöÄ Quick Start

### System Requirements

- Docker 19.03+
- Docker Compose 1.27+

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

2. Download this project, or directly create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
# Usage Instructions:
# 1. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the service
# 2. Run `docker-compose logs -f` to view logs
# 3. Result files are saved in the `./results` directory
# 4. Custom IP file is located at `./config/custom_ips.txt`
# 5. To rebuild the image for latest updates, uncomment the build option and comment out the image option
# 6. The service will run as a scheduled task by default, with interval configurable in config.yml
# 7. IPv6 network is supported, if not needed you can delete the networks configuration section

version: '3'

# Configure network, enable IPv6 support
networks:
  cfips-network:
    driver: bridge
    enable_ipv6: true
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 172.28.0.0/16
          gateway: 172.28.0.1
        - subnet: 2001:db8::/64
          gateway: 2001:db8::1

services:
  cfips:
    image: qiqi8699/cfips-auto:latest
    container_name: cfips-auto
    ports:
      - "15000:15000"  # IP optimization port
      - "15001:15001"  # Speed testing port
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config  # Configuration directory
      - ./results:/app/results  # Results output directory
      - ./logs:/app/logs  # Logs directory
    environment:
      - TZ=Asia/Shanghai
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "test", "-f", "/tmp/healthy"]
      interval: 5m
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
    # Use custom network to support IPv6
    networks:
      - cfips-network
```

3. Create related directories and configuration files:

```bash
mkdir -p config results logs
```

4. Start the service:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

5. View service logs:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

### IPv6 Support Information

- The default docker-compose.yml is already configured to support IPv6 networks
- The system will automatically detect the host machine's IPv6 connectivity
- If available IPv6 network is detected, both IPv4 and IPv6 will be tested
- If your host machine supports IPv6 but the container cannot connect, please check:
  - Whether Docker daemon configuration has enabled IPv6 support
  - Whether the host firewall allows IPv6 traffic
  - Ensure the host machine itself has available IPv6 connection

If IPv6 support is not needed, you can remove the networks related configuration from the docker-compose.yml file.

#### One-click Enable Docker IPv6 Support

The project provides a one-click configuration script to help you quickly enable Docker's IPv6 support on the host machine:

```bash
# Download script
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/cfips-auto/main/scripts/enable-docker-ipv6.sh

# Add execution permission
chmod +x enable-docker-ipv6.sh

# Run script with sudo (root permission required to modify Docker configuration)
sudo ./enable-docker-ipv6.sh
```

**Important Notes:**
- This script must be run on the **host system**, not inside the Docker container
- The script will automatically backup existing Docker configuration
- It will automatically restart the Docker service to apply changes
- After running, you may need to rebuild Docker networks and restart containers

### Non-Docker Deployment

For direct deployment on Linux systems, ensure the system has the following dependencies installed:

- bash
- curl
- awk
- sed
- grep
- jq

After cloning the repository, execute:

```bash
chmod +x setup-permissions.sh
./setup-permissions.sh
./start.sh all
```

## üìÇ Directory Structure

- **config/** - Configuration directory, contains config.yml and custom IP files
- **results/** - Optimization and speed test results output directory
- **logs/** - Log files directory
- **data/** - Tools and data files (for container internal use, no need to mount)
- **bin/** - Function execution scripts directory
- **utils/** - Utility function scripts directory

## üéÆ Usage

### Web Interface Usage

- Visit `http://[host IP]:15000` to trigger IP optimization function
- Visit `http://[host IP]:15001` to trigger IP speed testing function

### Command Line Usage

Execute in Docker environment:

```bash
# Execute complete process (optimization + speed testing + upload + notification)
docker exec -it cfips-auto /app/start.sh all

# Only execute IP optimization
docker exec -it cfips-auto /app/start.sh select

# Only execute speed testing
docker exec -it cfips-auto /app/start.sh test

# Set scheduled task (execute every 6 hours)
docker exec -it cfips-auto /app/start.sh schedule -i 360
```

### Custom IPs

1. Edit the `config/custom_ips.txt` file, add your collected quality IP addresses, one IP per line
2. Ensure custom IP library function is enabled in `config.yml`:

   ```yaml
   ip_select:
     custom_ips:
       enabled: true
       files:
         - "config/custom_ips.txt"
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Details

The project's configuration file is located at `config/config.yml`, supporting the following main configurations:

### IP Optimization Configuration

```yaml
ip_select:
  candidate_num: 20          # Number of candidate IPs per region
  final_num: 6               # Number of final selected IPs per region
  port: 15000                # Optimization function listening port
  allow_external: true       # Whether to allow external connections

  # Custom IP library configuration
  custom_ips:
    enabled: true            # Whether to enable custom IP library

      - "config/custom_ips.txt"  # Custom IP file path

  # IP port configuration
  port_config:
    enabled: true            # Whether to add port information in results
    default_port: 443        # Default port, options: 443, 8443, 2053, 2083, 2087, 2086
    random_port: false       # Whether to use random port (randomly select from available ports)
```

### Speed Testing Configuration

```yaml
speed_test:
  speed_limit: 0             # Download speed lower limit (MB/s), 0 for no limit
  latency_limit: 500         # Latency upper limit (ms)
  test_count: 0              # Number of IPs to test (0 = test all)

  test_url: ""               # Custom speed testing URL (leave empty to use default)
  port: 15001                # Speed testing function listening port
  allow_external: true       # Whether to allow external connections
```

### Result Upload Configuration

```yaml
upload:
  # Cloudflare KV configuration
  cloudflare:
    enabled: true            # Whether to enable Cloudflare KV upload
    domain: "example.com"    # Cloudflare KV domain
    token: "your_token"      # Cloudflare KV token

  # GitHub Gist configuration
  github:
    enabled: false           # Whether to enable GitHub Gist upload
    token: ""                # GitHub personal access token

## ‚ùì FAQ

### How to view optimization results?

Optimization results are saved in the `results` directory, main files include:
- `cfips.csv` - Detailed information of optimized IPs
- `cfips.txt` - Formatted IP#city results
- `result.csv` - Detailed results after speed testing
- `result_ip.txt` - Simplified IP results after speed testing

### How to add my collected IPs?

Add IP addresses to the `config/custom_ips.txt` file, one IP address per line, supports IPv4 and IPv6, then ensure the custom IP library function is enabled in the configuration file.

### Why are there no speed test results?

Usually due to network environment limitations or speed test conditions set too high. Try lowering the `speed_limit` or increasing the `latency_limit` value in the configuration file.

### How to update configuration?

After modifying the `config/config.yml` file, you don't need to restart the container, the new configuration will be automatically applied the next time the task is executed.

## üîí Privacy and Security

This tool only tests public Cloudflare IP addresses and does not collect or upload user personal information. The upload function requires users to provide their own tokens and service configuration.
